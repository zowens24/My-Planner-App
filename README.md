# Project 2 - My Planner

Second dev project! This is a daily planner for more than just everyday tasks. It's the combination of an everyday planner, journal, goal setter, and even includes a section for getting to know yourself a bit better! It could be used for better organization as well as finding out more about who you are and who you would like to become!
